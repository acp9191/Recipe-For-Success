# Recipe-For-Success

This app runs on top of the New York Times Cooking website. The website contains lots of great recipes with great information, but unfortunately small fonts and a busy page layout makes it hard to read while actually cooking. I saw this as an opportunity to make it better using a simple Google Chrome extension.

When the extension app is clicked, the page is transformed into an easy to read, user-friendly website that is actually usable while in the heat of the kitchen. Ingredients are transformed from sentences into a table consisting of:
 - quantity
 - measurement
 - actual ingredient
 - prep/other info (available on hover)

Links to Google search of ingredient can be found by clicking on the ingredient itself.
 
The instructions are made larger and easier to read, with the ingredients bolded, making it easy to pick out what is necessary in each step.

This is a work in progress and I am open to any and all contructive criticism that can be used to improve my project. Until then, enjoy!

Disclaimer: This app does not work perfectly for every single recipe yet, but I would eventually like it to! Also, it is exclusive to NYT Cooking right now, but ideally it could scale to be used on any well-written recipe website.
